     <h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
     <p>Time complexity of an algorithm is defined as the amount of time it takes to complete a task and indicates how efficient the algorithm is.</p>
     <p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an Algorithm is defined as how much space is required to complete the task and how efficient is the algorithm and the worst case is O(n)</p>
